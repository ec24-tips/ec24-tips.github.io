The park is however not always as clean as the rest of the city, and there is no real beach (you get into half a meter of water directly from 30cm above the water). Be careful to not get too close to the ports which are at both sides of the park. </p><p>This is not an official beach, so there is no surveillance, no changing room, and generally no infrastructure for swimming. There is also no entrance fee.</p>",
