Be careful to not get too close to the ports which are at both sides of the park. <p/></p>This is not an official beach, so there is no surveillance, no changing room, and generally no infrastructure for swimming. There is also no entrance fee.<p/>",

If you get lost, go down the hill: As it is encircled by Zürich and neighboring towns, this will help finding mean of transportation back to the city.<p/>",
